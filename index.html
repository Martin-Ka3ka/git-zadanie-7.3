			<h1>Aretha Franklin</h1>
				<h2>Angel</h2>
				<p>I got a call the other day
					It was my sister, Carolyn, sayin
					Aretha, come by when you can
					I've got somethin I wanna say.
					And when I got there she said
					You know, rather than go through a long drawn out thing,
					I think the melody on the box, will help me explain.
				</p>
		</div> 
		<div>
			<h2>Chorus</h2>
				<p>Gotta find me an angel, to fly away with me
                 	Gotta find me an angel, ooh and set me free
					My heart is without a whole, I don't want to be alone
					I gotta find me an angel in my life, in my life
					Too long have I loved, so unattached within
					So much that I know that I need somebody so
					So I'll just go on hoping that I find me someone
					Find me an angel in my life
					In my life
				</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h2>Second verse<h2>
				<p>I know there must be someone, somewhere for me
					Oh I lived too long without the love of someone
					And there's no misery ooooooh oooh like the misery
					I feel in me, gotta find me an angel in my life
					(He'll be there now don't you worry)
					My life (keep lookin and just keep cookin)
					My life (he'll be there, now don?t you worry)
					My life
				</p>
